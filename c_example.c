/* Module Description
** ------------------
**
** The C implementation file defines the C functions and potentially also places
** the definition of global or file local scope data variables.  The file should
** have the following organization.
**
** 1- Header file inclusions.
**
**    - First, include the "*interface definition*" header that declares every
**      public (global scope) function implemented by this C implementation
**      file.  Any global variable should be declared as ``extern`` inside the
**      header file (although the use of such global scope variables is strongly
**      discouraged, only use them on specific purpose and only when you
**      understand the consequences).
**
**    - Include the other headers after:
**
**      - Start with the most specific headers, such as project related headers.
**      - Place all system headers, which are more general, at the end.
**
**    This rule enforces the philosophy of ensuring that each header is
**    self-sufficient and includes what it must to incorporate every necessary
**    declaration.
**
**    The rule provides the correct environment to create unit test code or test
**    programs that will only need to include the headers declaring the
**    functions and data structures they use *directly*.
**
** 2- Define any local types: C data types that are only used inside this C
**    implementation file.
**
** 3- Declare all local C functions.  Write their C function prototype of all
**    local static functions.  These functions are only accessible to other
**    functions inside this file and will not be available from outside.
**
**      Putting their declaration first helps documenting code and allows
**      ordering the functions such that the parent function is placed before
**      the functions it calls.
**
** 4- Define local variables.Variables that have static linkage and have file
**    local scope.  They will be visible to all C functions implemented in this
**    file.
**
** 5- The set of C functions definition is placed last.

/* Header Inclusion
** ----------------
**
**  Note: the first header included should be the header defining the
**  'interface' of this implementation file.  It should also be included with
**  the include "" style.  If the file is inside the same directory nothing else
**  is required.  If the file is located inside another directory, write the
**  relative path (#include "../c_example.h" for instance).
**
**  Headers from other libraries and system headers should be included with the
**  #include <> style and should be placed after.
